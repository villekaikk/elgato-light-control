Desktop application for controlling Elgato lights. Primarily targeted for Linux, as there is no official software available but Windows build is also available as a Zip file.

## Currently supported Elgate light devices:
- Key Light Air

(More to come, once I get other lights to tinker with)

## Installation
### Arch Linux
> Coming soon

### Others
> TBD
